# PICO-8 Cartridges

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games.

Cartridges in PICO-8 are actually .png files that can be easily shared.

This repo contains my cartridges (abbreviated to carts), both raw source code (.p8 format) and PNG format.
